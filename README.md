### Phase 4 Requirements
In phase 4, we will be completing work on our Virtual Store by adding a two full page views to the application: Product Details and Checkout

### User Stories

As a user, I want to see a full detail view of a product so that I can make a more informed choice about purchasing it.
As a user, I want to view my full cart and initiate the checkout process so that I can purchase my items and have them delivered


### Technical Tasks

1- adding route to the apolication
2- link each product to a different page where it displays the product details
3- link to the cart in the header to the shopping cart page which includes shipping and payment forms.
4- using redux Toolkit instead of a regular redux store.
